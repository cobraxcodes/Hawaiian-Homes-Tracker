The Hawaiian Homes Tracker is a user-friendly web application designed to streamline the management of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands waitlist for native Hawaiian homestead applicants. Inspired by the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, this project addresses the lack of accessible digital tools for tracking waitlist data.
